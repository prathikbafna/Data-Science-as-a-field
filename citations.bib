	abstract = {The RADCURE dataset was collected clinically for radiation therapy treatment planning and retrospectively reconstructed for quantitative imaging research. Acquisition and Validation Methods: RADCURE is comprised of data for 3,346 patients and contains computed tomography (CT) images with corresponding normal and non-normal tissue contours. CT scans were collected using systems from three different manufacturers. Standard clinical imaging protocols were followed, and contours were generated and reviewed at weekly quality assurance rounds. RADCURE imaging and structure set data was extracted from our institution’s radiation treatment planning and oncology systems using an in-house data mining and processing system. Furthermore, images are linked to clinical data for each patient and includes demographic, clinical and treatment information based on the 7th edition TNM staging system. The median patient age is 63, with the final dataset including 80\% males. Oropharyngeal cancer makes up 50\% of the population with larynx, nasopharynx, and hypopharynx cancer, comprising 25, 12, and 5\% respectively. Median follow-up was 5 years with 60\% of the patients alive at last follow-up.},
