<h1>Final project report</h1>
<h3>Brief Overview</h3>
<p>This is our final project report for DTSC-5301 looking at a data set comprised of 3,346 patients clinically collected radiation therapy results. The median age for those participating in the study is 63, and is comprised of 80% males and 20% females.</p>

<p>Some questions that interested the team as a whole were as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a primary cancer site that is more common with smokers than with non-smokers?</li>
<li>How likely is it that the cancer contains HPV cells? What treatments are most common among patients with HPV cells? Does treatment take longer for patients with HPV cells than without HPV cells? Does the presence of HPV cells influence how successful treatment is?</li>
<li>What is the survival rate for oropharyngeal cancer? Does gender, age, smoking, treatment type, tumor size and HPV cells influence chances of survival?</li>
<li>Is there a relationship between ECOG PS and the stage of the cancer? How is this influenced by the presence of HPV cells and the size of the tumor?</li>
<li>What treatment is most commonly used for smokers? Is this treatment more successful if a patient does not currently smoke? Are patients who do smoke more likely to relapse?</li>
<li>Is there a higher chance of relapse if chemo is used in the treatment?</li>
<li>If a person was diagnosed prior to 2005, did they relapse/have cancer spread more than those who were diagnosed after 2005?</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the question list was identified, it was broken down into two different visualization sections, some were done by Python and some done by Tableau.</p>
